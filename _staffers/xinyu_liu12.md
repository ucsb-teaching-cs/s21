Hello everyone, welcome to CS8! I am currently an MSCS student at UCSB, and S22 is my second quarter working as a TA. It has been 7 years since I print the first "Hello World!" on my screen, and I hope my knowledge of Computer Science and experience with coding (especially in Python) can help you all this quarter. For CS 8, as the first programming course for many of you, coding can be confusing at first, so feel free to ask questions :) Once you understand the logic behind those "nonsense", it will never betray you.
