Hey, my name is Sam, and I'm a fourth year CS major graduating this upcoming quarter! Following graduation, I will be joining Amazon as a software development engineer up in Seattle! Also, this is my first time being an Undergraduate Learning Assistant and I'm really stoked for this amazing opportunity. 

My exploration into computer science outside the academic landscape began in the tumultuous halls of my freshman dorm. In an auspicious event, I happened to find a mutual friend within my dorm who shared a similar fervor in exploring programming. This proved to be the inevitable catalyst for my first personal project. Together, we decided to learn the programming language Python with the vision of eventually developing a substantial program. Every subsequent week, my friend and I would meet and discuss the newfound insights we had amassed on the programming language. And as our experimenting began to elucidate the language’s rules, we began to envision the many sprawling possibilities this new tool could provide. This ritual ultimately culminated into a functioning terminal-based version of the game Battleship. Although our initial project was provincial, it manifested a sense of creativity, exhilaration and cooperation that still drives my passion for computer science.

As a graduating senior, I hope to offer any guidance I can to the upcoming graduating classes. If you are at all interested in hearing about my experience at UCSB or are looking for some mentorship feel free to drop by my office hours or shoot me an email.

In my free time, I enjoy playing spike-ball and videogames with friends, experimenting with different cooking recipes, and learning new things! Recently, I got a sony A6100 camera and have been snapping pictures of sunsets and my Shiba. 

I am extremely excited to interact with you all throughout my last quarter here. I hope to meet many new faces!
