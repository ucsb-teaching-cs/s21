Hello dear students! Welcome to CS 8 Winter-22! I am so excited to introduce myself to you and get to know you all. I am Shereen Elsayed, I am a second year graduate student at CS. I am also a mother of 11 months baby monester boy (Mado). I have 5 years of experience of software development at Siemens using several programming languages (Java, c, c++, and python) along with some scripting languages (Perl, PHP, TCL/TK, shell,...etc.) Also I am experienced with hardware descriptive languages like VHDL and Verilog. I also worked at Race-Lab at UCSB as a software developer before joining the lab as a researcher. I enjoyed working with several scientists and astronauts to create a python package to ease creation of a pub/sub system using Kafka servers. Finally, I was a TA in CS-8 for 2 quarters now and I am so glad I will be your TA this quarter too. I hope I can be the best help for you all. Please never ever hesitate to contact me for any help or support :) Iâ€™d always be happy to assist you.
