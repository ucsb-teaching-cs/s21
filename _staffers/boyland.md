Hello everyone! I'm Peter Faith Boyland, in my third year as a PhD student in the Computer Science Department. I am working on Rust and in particular conversion of existing code from C/C++ into Rust to increase its safety. I really enjoy mentoring students, and I think it's especially important in remote classes like this one that you can get help from us in understanding the basic concepts of programming. In my spare time, I like to play boardgames, both simple and complex, and reading in all sorts of genres, including non-computer science academic fields.
