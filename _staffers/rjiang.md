Hello! I'm Rachel and I'm a first year pre-econ major who loves cs. It's great to meet you and I'm excited to be with you on your journey through CS 8. My one-sentence piece of advise is to manage your time well as you work through the quarter. You got this, and you'll have lots of fun! Welcome of CS8. 

A little bit about myself... My programming journey started in high school with Java, then I learned Python through CS 8 in the fall quarter. My favorite way of learning programming, besides attending classes, is watching FreeCodeCamps on Youtube. Other alternatives I use include the 7-day free trial subscription to Coursera courses. In my free time, I prefer simple things: run, read, talk, and listen to music. I'm currently working on a project with my teammates from the New Venture Challenge. If you're interested in technology and innovation, feel free to stop by my office hours and chat. I love exchanging ideas. 

Looking foreward to a great quarter with you all. Welcome to CS 8!
