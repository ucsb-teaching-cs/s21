Hi, I am Shailja. I am a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, UCSB. I am pursuing my research at the intersection of computer vision, graph theory, and computational geometry at Prof. Manjunath's [Vision Research Lab](https://vision.ece.ucsb.edu/). Visit my [webpage](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~shailja/) for more details on my research. I love teaching and mentoring students. Iâ€™m really excited to be involved with this class. In my free time I play chess daily and tennis almost every week. Feel free to drop by my office hours if you have any questions or simply want to chat.
